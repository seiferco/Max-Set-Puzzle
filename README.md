# Maximum Independent Set of Non-Adjacent Elements
This project implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in a given list. The problem is commonly referred to as the "Maximum Independent Set" problem for arrays of integers, where we aim to select elements such that no two selected elements are adjacent.

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers (which can include both positive and negative values), the task is to select a subset of the numbers such that:
- No two selected numbers are adjacent in the array.
- The sum of the selected numbers is maximized.

#### Example
For the input array:
nums = [7,2,5,8,6]
the will return [7,8,6] with a sum of 21

## How to run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python MaxSet.py
